msgid "Both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide tools to make it easy to manage software and to keep both the operating system and installed software up-to-date. PC-BSD® provides the graphical :ref:`AppCafe®` and :ref:`Update Manager` utilities for managing and upgrading software from the local system or from a web browser or mobile device. Since TrueOS® is a command-line only install and some users prefer to use command-line utilities, both PC-BSD® and TrueOS® provide the :command:`pkg` command line utility to manage software, as well as :command:`pc-updatemanager` to manage updates. If you install software using any of the tools described in this chapter, you will automatically be notified whenever a newer version of software is available."

It provides a graphical front-end to FreeBSD packages, which are pre-built applications that have been tested for FreeBSD. It also provides a front-end to PBIs, which are packages that contain extra meta-data which is displayed in AppCafe®, such as screenshots and lists of similar applications. It also provides graphical jail management, which allows you to run applications which are isolated from the rest of the operating system."

On a desktop installation, AppCafe® can be run as a local application and optionally configured for remote access. To launch the AppCafe® application on a PC-BSD® desktop, double-click its icon on the Desktop, go to :menuselection:`Control Panel --> AppCafe®`, or type :command:`appcafe` from a command prompt.

A jail is similar to running an independent instance of FreeBSD on the same hardware, without all of the overhead usually associated with virtualization. Jails are usually created for running applications or services. For example, you could host your own media server on your desktop system without affecting other installed applications or your data.
